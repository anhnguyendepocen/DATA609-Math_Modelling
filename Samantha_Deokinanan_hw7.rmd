### Homework #7.1

#### Page B-17: #1  

Build a numerical solution to:

$y_{n+1} = 120 + \frac {1}{2} x_n$  
$x_{n+1} = 60 + \frac {1}{3} y_n$  

with Country X, $x_0 = 100$ and Country Y, $y_0 = 200$.

a. Graph your results.   

```{r}
NumSol = function(x0, y0, n0){
    x = x0;    y = y0;    n = 0:n0
    for (i in 1 : n0){
        y[i+1] = 120 + (1/2) * x[i] 
        x[i+1] = 60 + (1/3) * y[i]
    }
    return(data.frame(n,x,y)) 
}

solution = NumSol(100,200,10)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(solution, aes(x = n)) + geom_line(aes(y = x, colour = "X")) + geom_line(aes(y = y, colour = "Y")) + labs(title = "Plot of an Arms Race", x = "stage", y = "# of weapons")
```

b. Is an equilibrium value reached? 

```{r}
NumSol(100,200,20)
```

Yes, an equilibrium is eventually stabilized after t = 15.

c. Try other starting values. Do you think the equilibrium value is stable?   

```{r}
one = NumSol(0,0,20)
p1 = ggplot(one, aes(x = n)) + geom_line(aes(y = x, colour = "X")) + geom_line(aes(y = y, colour = "Y")) + labs(title = "Lower than expected Equilibrium", x = "stage", y = "# of weapons")

two = NumSol(120,180,20)
p2 = ggplot(two, aes(x = n)) + geom_line(aes(y = x, colour = "X")) + geom_line(aes(y = y, colour = "Y")) + labs(title = "At expected Equilibrium", x = "stage", y = "# of weapons")

three = NumSol(200,200,20)
p3 = ggplot(three, aes(x = n)) + geom_line(aes(y = x, colour = "X")) + geom_line(aes(y = y, colour = "Y")) + labs(title = "Higher than expected Equilibrium", x = "stage", y = "# of weapons")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 3, ncol = 1)
```

Based on these plots, it is clear that the equilibrium is stable since it is reach only after a few iterations.

d. Explore other values for the survival coefficients of Countries X and Y . Describe your results.  

```{r}
set.seed(2319)
NumSol = function(x0, y0, n0){
    x = x0;    y = y0;    n = 0:n0
    a = runif(1)
    b = runif(1)
    for (i in 1 : n0){
        y[i+1] = 120 + (a) * x[i] 
        x[i+1] = 60 + (b) * y[i]
    }
    df = data.frame(n,x,y)
    p = ggplot(df, aes(x = n)) + geom_line(aes(y = x, colour = "X")) + geom_line(aes(y = y, colour = "Y")) + 
      labs(title = sprintf("a = %0.2f, b = %0.2f", a, b), x = "stage", y = "# of weapons")
    return(p) 
}

p1 = NumSol(100,100,20)
p2 = NumSol(150,252,20)
p3 = NumSol(80,75,20)
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 3, ncol = 1)
```

Based on the plots, it is clear that the equilibrium values are highly sensitive to the assumed survival coefficients used in the different models. It is more important to note, however, that the equilibrium does stabilized after a few iterations.

Show that when the demand curve is very steep, a tax added to each item sold will fall primarily on consumers. Now show that when the demand curve is more nearly horizontal, the tax is paid mostly by the industry. What if the supply curve is very steep? What if the supply curve is nearly horizontal?

There are 4 distinct curves in this case. During a growth period when the supply curve is steep, customers are more likely to purchase products since industries are more responsible for the tax. When the supply curve is nearly horizontal, consumers are responsible for the tax. This relationship is the flips when considering the demand curve. Let's take a look:

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height=8, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tax_demand = function(supply, demand, tax, type){
  require(DescTools)

  supply_tax = supply[,2] + tax

  plot(NA, NA, xlim = c(1, 10), ylim = c(-1, 14), xlab = "q", ylab = "p", main = sprintf("%s Curve with Tax", type, tax))
  legend("bottomright", c("Demand", "Supply", "Supply + Tax"), title = "Curves", fill = c("red", "blue", "green"))
  grid()
  DrawBezier(x = supply[,1], y = supply[,2], col = "blue", lwd = 2)
  DrawBezier(x = supply[,1], y = supply_tax, col = "green", lwd = 2)
  DrawBezier(x = demand[,1], y = demand[,2], col = "red", lwd = 2)
}

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
s = cbind(c(1, 6, 10), c(1, 5, 9)); d = cbind(c(4, 5, 6), c(10, 2, 1))
p1 = tax_demand(s, d, 5, "Steep Demand")

s = cbind(c(1, 6, 10), c(1, 5, 9)); d = cbind(c(3, 5, 10), c(9, 9, 8))
p2 = tax_demand(s, d, 5, "Nearly Horizontal Demand")

s = cbind(c(2, 3, 5), c(1, 1, 10)); d = cbind(c(1, 5, 7), c(11, 4, 2))
p3 = tax_demand(s, d, 5, "Steep Supply")

s = cbind(c(2, 3, 8), c(3, 3, 4)); d = cbind(c(1, 5, 7), c(11, 4, 2))
p4 = tax_demand(s, d, 5, "Nearly Horizontal Supply")
```

Examining the plots, it is clear that the consumer pays more of the tax burden when there is nearly horizontal supply curve, leaving industry to pay less of the tax. Conversely, with a nearly horizontal the demand curve, the consumer is responsible for a smaller percentage of the tax burden. With a steep supply curve, the consumer is responsible a smaller percentage of the tax burden, and the industry pays most of the tax. Whereas, with a steep demand, consumer pays more of the tax burden.

### Homework #7.2 
***  

[Question's link](http://optlab-server.sce.carleton.ca/POAnimations2007/BranchAndBound.html)

A company is assembling a team to carry out a series of operations. There are four members of the team: A, B, C and D, and four operations to be carried out. Each team member can carry out exactly one operation. All four operations must be carried out successfully for the overall project to succeed, however the probability of a particular team member succeeding in a particular operation varies, as shown in the table below. For example, if the team members were assigned to operations in the order ABCD, then the overall probability of successful completion of the project is (0.9)(0.6)(0.85)(0.7) = 0.3213. If there is any possible way that the team can be arranged such that the overall probability of success exceeds 45%, then the manager will approve the project. Will the manager approve the project? If yes, what is the arrangement of the team that gives the highest probability of success?

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("     1   2    3    4
A 0.90 0.8 0.90 0.85
B 0.70 0.6 0.80 0.70
C 0.85 0.7 0.85 0.80
D 0.75 0.7 0.75 0.70")
```

The formulation of the problem is described as:  

* *Meaning of a node in the branch and bound tree*: a partial or complete assignment of team members to operations.  

* *Node selection policy*: global maximum of the bounding function.  

* *Variable selection policy*: choose operations in natural order, i.e. 1 through 4.  

* *Bounding function*: choose the unassigned team member with the maximum probability, even if member was used in previous tasks. This function is less restrictive then the original problem constraint where individual team members can only be used once.  

* *Terminating Rule*: when incumbent solution objective function is greater or equal to bounding function values associated with all bud nodes.  

##### SOLUTION

Starting at the root node, there is no decision made, so determine the best person for each job. In this case, person $A$ has the best probability of success, therefore the bounding value is $(0.9)(0.8)(0.9)(0.85) = 0.5508$.

Now, branch off to the first operation where selected member cannot be repeated. Note that ACCC and ADCC result in the same probability. Moreover, Node C was found to have the maximum value.

Branching on Node CAAA, a feasible solution is obtained, i.e. CABD = 0.3808. This is now set as the incumbent as the remaining nodes are expanded on.

![](C:/Users/Deokinanan/OneDrive - CUNY School of Professional Studies/2019 -2021 CUNY SPS/SPRING 2020/DATA 609/Week 13 - 14/3.jpg)

Expand on Node DAAA because it has the highest bounding function. Note there is not feasible solution, and Node DBAA is lower than the current incumbent value, therefore, this node can be pruned.

![](C:/Users/Deokinanan/OneDrive - CUNY School of Professional Studies/2019 -2021 CUNY SPS/SPRING 2020/DATA 609/Week 13 - 14/4.jpg)

Branch on Node CDAA because it has the highest bounding function. Two feasible solutions are found but with Node CDBA having this higher probability, it is now the new incumbent value, and all other branch can be prune.

![](C:/Users/Deokinanan/OneDrive - CUNY School of Professional Studies/2019 -2021 CUNY SPS/SPRING 2020/DATA 609/Week 13 - 14/5.jpg)

Expand on both ACCC and BAAA since they are tied, and prune branches that have lower values than the current incumbent value.

![](C:/Users/Deokinanan/OneDrive - CUNY School of Professional Studies/2019 -2021 CUNY SPS/SPRING 2020/DATA 609/Week 13 - 14/6.jpg)
 
Branch on Node BACC because it has the highest bounding function. Two feasible solutions are found but neither having a higher probability than the current incumbent value, therefore, these branches can be prune.

![](C:/Users/Deokinanan/OneDrive - CUNY School of Professional Studies/2019 -2021 CUNY SPS/SPRING 2020/DATA 609/Week 13 - 14/7.jpg)

Similarly, branch on Node ADCC because has the highest bounding function. Two feasible solutions are found but neither having a higher probability than the current incumbent value, therefore, these branches can be prune, ultimately ending this branch.

![](C:/Users/Deokinanan/OneDrive - CUNY School of Professional Studies/2019 -2021 CUNY SPS/SPRING 2020/DATA 609/Week 13 - 14/8.jpg)

Branch on Node DACC. Two feasible solutions are found but neither having a higher probability than the current incumbent value, therefore, these branches can be prune, ultimately ending this branch.


![](C:/Users/Deokinanan/OneDrive - CUNY School of Professional Studies/2019 -2021 CUNY SPS/SPRING 2020/DATA 609/Week 13 - 14/9.jpg)

There are no additional nodes left to expand. Therefore, it can be concluded that the arrangement of the team that gives the highest probability of success being 0.4046 is with person $C$, person $D$, person $B$, and person $A$. 

![](C:/Users/Deokinanan/OneDrive - CUNY School of Professional Studies/2019 -2021 CUNY SPS/SPRING 2020/DATA 609/Week 13 - 14/10.jpg)

Unfortunately, their probability of success is less than minimum desired probability of 0.45, with will result in a rejection of the project by the manager.
