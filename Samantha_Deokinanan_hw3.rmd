From the figure, we have that:

$R_{PA}(t) = 0.95$ is the reliability for the PA.  
$R_{CD}(t) = 0.98$ is the reliability for the CD.  
$R_{FM-AM}(t) = 0.97$ is the reliability for the FM-AM Radio.  
$R_{S1}(t) = 0.99$ is the reliability for the Speaker 1.  
$R_{S2}(t) = 0.99$ is the reliability for the Speaker 2.  

The assumption for this model is that there are three components in a series system with the last two of these components being parallel systems, such that:

For component 1, ie $R_{1}(t)$, the reliability is $R_{PA}(t) = 0.95$.    
For component 2, ie $R_{2}(t)$, the reliability is $R_{CD}(t) + R_{FM-AM}(t) - R_{CD}(t) \times R_{FM_AM}(t) = 0.98 + 0.97 - 0.98*0.97 = 0.9994$.    
For component 3, ie $R_{3}(t)$, the reliability is $R_{S1}(t) + R_{S2}(t) - R_{S1}(t) \times R_{S2}(t) = 0.99 + 0.99 - 0.99*0.99 = 0.9999$.  

Thus, the system reliability is $R_{1}(t) \times R_{2}(t) \times R_{3}(t) = (0.95)(0.9994)(0.9999) = 0.9493$.

#### Problem #2, pg 240

Use the basic linear model $y = ax + b$ to fit the following data sets. Provide the model, provide the values of $SSE, SSR, SST,$ and $R^2$, and provide a residual plot. 

Question 2: Predict weight as a function of the cube of the height.

The model is $weight = a \times height^3 + b$. Fitting the data to the model such that:

$a=\frac {m\sum {{xy} -\sum {x} \sum {y}}}{m\sum {{x}^{2}-{\left(\sum{x}  \right)}^{2}}}$

$b=\frac {\sum {{x^2} {\sum {y}} -\sum {xy} \sum {x}}}{m\sum {{x}^{2}-{\left(\sum{x}  \right)}^{2}}}$

where m = 21.

```{r}
height = c(60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80)
weight = c(132, 136, 141, 145, 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 201, 206, 212, 218, 223, 229, 234)

# The model, y = ax^3 + b
df = data.frame(height^3, weight)

df$xy = df$height*df$weight
df$x2 = df$height.3^2

sum = data.frame(colSums(df))
sum

m = 21

a = (m*sum[3,]-(sum[1,]*sum[2,]))/(m*sum[4,]-(sum[1,])^2)
b = ((sum[4,]*sum[2,])-(sum[3,]*sum[1,]))/(m*sum[4,]-(sum[1,])^2)

c(a, b)
```

Thus, the model is $weight = 0.000347 height^3 + 59.5$. Now, the following formulas are used to find the values of SSR, SSE and SST:

$SSE=\sum _{i=1}^{m}{\left( {y}_{i}-\left({ax}_{i}+b \right)  \right)^{2}}$

$SST=\sum _{i=1}^{m}{ \left( {y}_{i}-\bar {{y}_{i}} \right) ^{2}}$ 

$SSR = SST - SSE$

The coefficient of determination can be calculated using $R^2 = 1 - \frac {SSE}{SST}$.

```{r}
SSE = 0
SST = 0
for (i in c(1:21)){
  SSE = SSE + (df$weight[i] - (a*df$height.3[i] + b))^2 
  SST = SST + (df$weight[i] - mean(df$weight))^2
  SSR = SST - SSE
}

R2 = 1 - SSE/SST

data.frame(SSE = SSE, SST = SST, SSR = SSR, R2 = R2)
```

Using the model, a plot of the residual suggest that there is a scatter with no large differences between the actual and fitted data.

```{r}
predicted = 0.000347* height^3 + 59.5

residuals = weight - predicted

plot(weight, residuals)
abline(0, 0)
title("Plot of the residuals")
```

### Homework #3.2

#### Problem #2, pg 251

_Nutritional Requirements_ - A rancher has determined that the minimum weekly nutritional requirements for an average-sized horse include 40 lb of protein, 20 lb of carbohydrates, and 45 lb of roughage. These are obtained from the following sources in varying amounts at the prices indicated:


| |Protein (lb)|Carbohydrates (lb)|Roughage (lb)|Cost|
--|--|--|--|--|
Hay (per bale) | 0.5 |2.0| 5.0| $1.80|
Oats (per sack) | 1.0| 4.0 |2.0 |$3.50|
Feeding blocks (per block)|2.0| 0.5| 1.0 |$0.40|
High-protein concentrate (per sack) |6.0 |1.0| 2.5| $1.00|
Requirements per horse (per week) |40.0 |20.0| 45.0||

Formulate a mathematical model to determine how to meet the minimum nutritional requirements at minimum cost.

_Problem Identification_ : How should the rancher ration protein, carbohydrates and roughage to meet the minimum weekly nutritional requirements for an average-sized horse at a minimum cost?

_Decision variables_ :

* $x_1$ = pounds of hay  
* $x_2$ = pounds of oats  
* $x_3$ = pounds of feeding blocks  
* $x_4$ = pounds of high-protein concentrate  

_Problem_ : Minimize the model for cost , $cost = 1.80 x_1 + 3.50 x_2 + 0.40 x_3 + x_4$.

_Constraints_:

* (protein)  $0.5 x_1 + x_2 + 2.0 x_3 + 6.0 x_4 \ge 40.0$  
* (carbohydrates) $2.0 x_1 + 4.0 x_2 + 0.5 x_3 + x_4 \ge 20$  
* (roughage) $5.0 x_1 + 2.0 x_2 + x_3 + 2.5 x_4 \ge 45$  

where $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4 \ge 0$.

Checking the properties for optimization of a linear program, it is clear that this problem satisfy all 5 assumption. Specifically, there is a unique objective function, the cost function that is a linear expression representing the weekly cost of nutritional requirements for an average-size horse. All the decision variables appear only as a power term with an exponent of 1. There are no term in the cost function or in the constraints that is a product of the decision variables. Each constraint are constant and in the objective function. And lastly, the decision variables are permitted to assume fractional or integer values.

This problem mirrors that on the Investment Problem in the textbook on page 249. Specifically, Goal 1, trying to meet a yearly return of at least $5000, while all the constraints remains. Thus, this problem too can be solve using Simplex Method as a good method of optimization to obtain a solution.

Let's solve this problem using Simplex algorithm.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(linprog)
library(lpSolve)

obj = c(1.8, 3.5, 0.4, 1)
bvec = c(40, 20, 45)
constraints = rbind(c(0.5, 1, 2, 6), c(2, 4, 0.5, 1), c(5, 2, 1, 2.5))
solveLP(obj, bvec, constraints, const.dir =  c(">=", ">=", ">=" ), maximum = FALSE)
```

The results show that the optimal minimizer is c(5, 0, 20, 0), which equates to $17, while also meeting the nutritional constraints such that 42.5 lb of protein, 20 lb of carbohydrates, and 45 lb of roughage can be purchased.

#### Problem #6, pg 264

Using graphical analysis, maximize $10x + 35y$, subject to:

* $8x + 6y \le 48$ (board-feet of lumber)
* $4x + y = 20$ (hours of carpentry)
* $y \ge 5$ (demand)
* $x, y > 0$ (non-negativity)

Now, let's use the very powerful `ggplot2` for the graphical analysis using the following rearranged constraints:

* $y = - \frac {4}{3}x +8$   
* $y = -4x + 20$  
* $y = 5$  
* $x = 0$  

With the constraints, there are a few assumption on the solution. Firstly, with the non-negative constraints on x and y, the solution must be in the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane and $y â‰¥ 5$. Moreover, $y = - \frac {4}{3}x +8$ constraint further suggest the solution is below this line. Thus, the solution can be found within the region highlighted in the light-blue area of the graph.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

intersection = data.frame(x = c(0, 0, 2.25), y = c(5, 8, 5))

ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-1, 7)), aes(x)) + 
  stat_function(fun = function(x) -4/3*x + 8, geom = "line", aes(col = 'y = -4/3x + 8')) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) -4*x + 20, geom = "line", aes(col = 'y = -4x + 20')) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) 5, geom = "line", aes(col = 'y = 5')) + 
  geom_point(data = intersection, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_polygon(data = intersection, aes(x = x, y = y), fill="lightblue") + 
  annotate('text', x = 0, y = 9, label="(0, 8)", size = 3 ) +
  annotate('text', x = 0, y = 4, label="(0, 5)", size = 3 ) + 
  annotate('text', x = 2.25, y = 4, label="(2.25, 5)", size = 3 ) + 
  labs(title = 'Graphical Representation of the Constraints') 
```

Now that the intersection have been found. The optimal solution that maximize $10x + 35y$ is (0, 8) with a value of 280.

```{r}
obj.func = function(x,y) 10*x + 35*y
data.frame(x = c(0, 0, 2.25), y = c(5, 8, 5), 
           obj_func = c(obj.func(0, 5), obj.func(0, 8), obj.func(2.25, 5)))
```

Use the curve-fitting criterion to minimize the sum of the absolute deviations for the following models and data set:

* $y = ax$
* $y = ax^2$
* $y = ax^3$

To minimize the function $\Sigma {|y_i - y(x_i)|}$, let's use the golden search method with a tolerance level of 0.01, and initial interval of [0, 42]. 

```{r}
golden.search = function(f, x, y, a, b, t) {
  iteration = 0
  r = 0.618
  # Test points
  x1 = b - r * (b - a)
  x2 = a + r * (b - a)
  # Evaluate f(x) at each test point
  f1 = f(x1, x, y)
  f2 = f(x2, x, y)
  # Algorithm to select new interval
  while (abs(b - a) > t) {
    iteration = iteration + 1
    if (f2 >= f1) {
      b = x2
      x2 = x1
      f2 = f1
      x1 = b - r * (b - a)
      f1 = f(x1, x, y)
    } else {
      a = x1
      x1 = x2
      f1 = f2
      x2 = a + r * (b - a)
      f2 = f(x2, x, y)
    }
  }
  cat("Final lower bound =", a, "\n")
  cat("Final upper bound =", b, "\n")
  cat("Optimal x that minimizes the function is", (a + b) / 2, "which evaluates to", f((a + b) / 2, x, y), "\n")
}
