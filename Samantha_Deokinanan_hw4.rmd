```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(igraph)
df = data.frame(from = c("s", "s","s","s","x1","x1","x1","x1","x2","x2","x3","x3","x4","x4","y1","y2","y3","y4","y5","y6"), to = c("x1","x2","x3","x4","y1","y2","y4","y5","y3","y6","y1","y3","y1","y3","t","t","t","t","t","t"), capacity = c(1,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,1,1))

graph = simplify(graph.data.frame(df, directed = TRUE))
V(graph)$x = c(1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4)
V(graph)$y = c(4,6,5,2,1,6,5,4,3,2,1,4)
plot(graph, edge.label = E(graph)$capacity, vertex.label.color = "black")
```


From the graph, it is clear that the maximum flow $\leq min(|X|,|Y|) = min(4,6) = 4$. 

Set initial flow, $f_c = 0$.  
Finding directed paths from s to t to meet equilibrium: 

$s-x_1-y_1-t$ | $f_c = 1$ |   
$s-x_2-y_3-t$ | $f_c = 2$ | stop

$s-x_1-y_2-t$ | $f_c = 1$ |   
$s-x_2-y_3-t$ | $f_c = 2$ |   
$s-x_3-y_1-t$ | $f_c = 3$ | stop

$s-x_1-y_2-t$ | $u_{min} = 1$ | $u_{ij} = 0$ | $f_c = 1$ |  
$s-x_2-y_6-t$ | $u_{min} = 1$ | $u_{ij} = 0$ | $f_c = 2$ |  
$s-x_3-y_3-t$ | $u_{min} = 1$ | $u_{ij} = 0$ | $f_c = 3$ |  
$s-x_4-y_1-t$ | $u_{min} = 1$ | $u_{ij} = 0$ | $f_c = 4$ |  

The maximum flow from s to t is 4.

We can further confirm this using the `max_flow()` function from the  igraph package:

```{r}
(max_flow(graph, source = V(graph)["s"], target = V(graph)["t"]))$value
```

Write down the linear program associated with solving maximum flow from s to t in the graph below:

Recall that for linear programming, we are trying to solve for the solution that maximizes the objective equation with constraints, i.e.:

max : $c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + ... + c_nx_n$  

constraints:   
$a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + ... + a_{1n}x_n \leq b_1$   
$a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + ... + a_{2n}x_n \leq b_2$   
$...$  
$a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + ... + a_{mn}x_n \leq b_m$   

So begin by formulating the max flow problem into a linear programming one. Here, the use of the Simplex Method is applied to solve the problem:

*Objective function* : maximize the flow from s to t, i.e. $max(x_{sa} + x_{sb})$  

*Flow link variables*: $x_{ij} =$ amount of flow from $i \rightarrow j$    

*Flow capacity constraints*: The flow over any link cannot exceed the capacity of that link, i.e.  
$x_{sa} \leq 3, x_{sb}\leq 5,x_{ab}\leq 2,x_{ac}\leq 6,x_{bc}\leq 2, x_{bd}\leq 4, x_{cd}\leq 1, x_{ct}\leq 4, x_{dt}\leq 5$

*Flow conservation equation*:

$\forall$ node n $\neq {s, t}: \sum flow_{in} = \sum flow_{out}$

* node a: $x_{sa} = x_{ab} + x_{ac}$
* node b: $x_{sb} + x_{ab} = x_{bc} + x_{bd}$
* node c: $x_{ac} + x_{bc} = x_{cd} + x_{ct}$
* node d: $x_{bd} + x_{cd} = x_{dt}$


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
obj = c(1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0)
constraints = matrix(c(1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,
                       0,1,0,1,-1,-1,0,0,0,
                       0,0,1,0,1,0,-1,-1,0,
                       0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,-1), 4, 9, byrow = TRUE)
bvec = c(0,0,0,0)
upperbound = c(3,5,2,6,2,4,1,4,5)
pracma::linprog(obj, Aeq = constraints, beq = bvec, ub = upperbound, maximize = TRUE)
```

Thus, the linear program found that the maximum flow is 8.

Consider a firm handling concessions for a sporting event. The firmâ€™s manager needs to know whether to stock up with coffee or cola and is formulating policies for specific weather predictions. A local agreement restricts the firm to selling only one type of beverage. The firm estimates a \$1,500 profit selling cola if the weather is cold and a \$5,000 profit selling cola if the weather is warm. The firm also estimates a \$4,000 profit selling coffee if it is cold and a \$1,000 profit selling coffee if the weather is warm. The weather forecast says that there is a 30% of a cold front; otherwise, the weather will be warm. Build a decision tree to assist with the decision. What should the firm handling concessions do?

From the details above, it is clear that no matter what, the firm must sell both cola and coffee on any given day regardless of the weather, so:

$P(cold) = 0.3$  
$P(warm) = 0.7$

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("
----------------------------------------
                 |       Weather      
    Profit       |----------------------
                 |   Warm   |   Cold    
----------------------------------------
        | Cola   |  $5000   |  $1500
Beverage|-------------------------------
        | Coffee |  $1000   |  $4000
----------------------------------------")
```

Thus, the decision tree becomes:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(data.tree)
tree = Node$new("Beverage Decision")
  cola = tree$AddChild("Cola")
  p_cold = cola$AddChild("P(cold) = 0.30")
  p = p_cold$AddChild("Profit $450")
  p_warm = cola$AddChild("P(warm) = 0.70")
  p = p_warm$AddChild("Profit $3500")
  
  coffee = tree$AddChild("Coffee")
  p_cold = coffee$AddChild("P(cold) = 0.30")
  p = p_cold$AddChild("Profit $1200")
  p_warm = coffee$AddChild("P(warm) = 0.70")
  p = p_warm$AddChild("Profit $700")

plot(tree)
```

The firm handling concessions should consider selling more cola than coffee. On any given day, they can expect to make a profit of at least \$3950, whereas for coffee it is only a profit of \$1900.

A big private oil company must decide whether to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. It costs \$1 million to drill, and if oil is found its value is estimated at \$6 million. At present, the oil company believes that there is a 45% chance that oil is present. Before drilling begins, the big private oil company can hire a geologist for \$100,000 to obtain samples and test for oil. There is only about a 60% chance that the geologist will issue a favorable report. Given that the geologist does issue a favorable report, there is an 85% chance that there is oil. Given an unfavorable report, there is a 22% chance that there is oil. Determine what the big private oil company should do.

Let's determine the different expected payouts and expected values for each branch of the tree:

* Payout 1: Hire geologist $\rightarrow$ Drill $\rightarrow$ Struck Oil $= -\$100K - \$1M + \$6M = \$4.9M$
* Payout 2: Hire geologist $\rightarrow$ Drill $\rightarrow$ No Oil $= -\$100K - \$1M + \$0 = -\$1.1M$
* Payout 3: No geologist $\rightarrow$ Drill $\rightarrow$ Struck Oil $= \$0 - \$1M + \$6M = \$5M$
* Payout 4: No geologist $\rightarrow$ Drill $\rightarrow$ No Oil $= \$0 - \$1M + \$0 = -\$1M$
* Payout 5: No geologist $\rightarrow$ No Drill $\rightarrow$ No Oil $= \$0 + \$0 + \$0 = \$0$

* With a positive report from the geologist, EV $= \$4.9M \times 0.85 + (-\$1.1M) \times 0.15 = \$4M$  
* With a negative report from the geologist, EV $= \$4.9M \times 0.22 + (-\$1.1M) \times 0.78 = \$220K$  
* Thus, by hiring a geologist, EV $= \$4M \times 0.60 + \$220K \times 0.40 = \$2.488M$

* While, by not hiring a geologist, EV $= \$5M \times 0.45 + (-\$1M) \times 0.55 = \$1.7M$

```{r}
tree = Node$new("Decision \n EV = $2.488")
    geologist = tree$AddChild("Geologist \n EV = $2.488M")
    positive_report= geologist$AddChild("P(+) = 0.60")
    max = positive_report$AddChild("EV = $4M")
    oil = max$AddChild("P(Oil) = 0.85")
    payout_geo_drill_oil = oil$AddChild("$4.9M")
    no_oil = max$AddChild("P(No Oil) = 0.15")
    payout_geo_drill_no_oil = no_oil$AddChild("-$1.1M")
    
    neg_report = geologist$AddChild("P(-) = 0.40")
    max = neg_report$AddChild("EV = $220K")
    oil = max$AddChild("P(Oil) = 0.22")
    payout_geo_drill_oil = oil$AddChild("$4.9M")
    no_oil = max$AddChild("P(No Oil) = 0.78")
    payout_geo_drill_no_oil = no_oil$AddChild("-$1.1M")
    
    no_geologist = tree$AddChild("No Geologist \n EV = $1.7M")
    drill = no_geologist$AddChild("Drill")
    max = drill$AddChild("EV = $1.7M")
    oil = max$AddChild("P(Oil) = 0.45")
    payout_drill_oil = oil$AddChild("$5M")
    no_oil = max$AddChild("P(No Oil) = 0.55")
    payout_drill_no_oil =no_oil$AddChild("-$1M")
    
    no_drill = no_geologist$AddChild("No Drill")
    max = no_drill$AddChild("EV = $0")

plot(tree)
```

In conclusion, the oil company is better off hiring a geologist since the expected value is $2,488,000.

Alternatives | p = 0.35 | p = 0.3 | p = 0.25 | p = 0.1
             |    1     |    2    |    3     |    4
--------------------------------------------------------
     A       |  1100    |   900   |   400    |   300
     B       |   850    |  1500   |  1000    |   500
     C       |   700    |  1200   |   500    |   900    
--------------------------------------------------------")
```

a. Which alternative do we choose if our criterion is to maximize the expected value? 

The expected value for each alternatives is:

Alternative A  
$EV(A) = 1100 \times 0.35 + 900 \times 0.3 + 400 \times 0.25 + 300 \times 0.1 = 785$

Alternative B  
$EV(A) = 850 \times 0.35 + 1500 \times 0.3 + 1000 \times 0.25 + 500 \times 0.1 = 1047.50$

Alternative C   
$EV(A) = 700 \times 0.35 + 1200 \times 0.3 + 500 \times 0.25 + 900 \times 0.1 = 820$

Thus, we choose Alternative B since it has the maximum expected value, EV(B) = 1047.50.

b. Find the opportunity loss (regret) table and compute the expected opportunity loss (regret) for each alternative. What decision do you make if your criterion is to minimize expected regret?  

The mini-max regret criterion minimizes the opportunity loss. We build a table of opportunity loss and find the expected opportunity loss.

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("
States of Nature : Regret Matrix

Alternatives |     p = 0.35     |      p = 0.3      |      p = 0.25    |    p = 0.1      | Maximum | EV(loss) 
             |        1         |          2        |         3        |       4         | Regret  |

     A       | 1100 - 1100 = 0  | 1500 - 900 = 600  | 1000 - 400 = 600 | 900 - 300 = 600 |   600   |   390
     B       | 1100 - 850 = 250 | 1500 - 1500 = 0   | 1000 - 1000 = 0  | 900 - 500 = 400 |   400   | 127.50
     C       | 1100 - 700 = 400 | 1500 - 1200 = 300 | 1000 - 500 = 500 | 900 - 900 = 0   |   500   |   355
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
```

From the opportunity loss table, to minimize the expected regret, we choose Alternative B, which has the least maximum regret of 400 than the other Alternatives, and the smallest expected opportunity loss (regret) of EV(B loss) = 127.50.
